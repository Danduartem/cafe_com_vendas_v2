# Offer Section — Checklist

> High-level, creative-friendly reference to design a **visually stunning, high-converting** Offer section for your live event.

## 1) Purpose & Core Promise
- [ ] One clear, benefit-driven headline that states the promise (sell more, work fewer hours).
- [ ] Short subheadline that adds context (who it’s for + what they get).
- [ ] Optional micro-copy that emphasizes outcome, not features.

## 2) Visual Hierarchy & Eye Path
- [ ] Layout guides eyes **1) Headline → 2) Value bullets/visual → 3) CTA**.
- [ ] Strong contrast and size for the headline; subhead is clearly secondary.
- [ ] CTA is visually distinct and reachable without hunting.
- [ ] Whitespace separates blocks; no visual clutter.

## 3) Value Stack (What They Get)
- [ ] 3–5 concise benefit bullets (outcomes > features).
- [ ] Optional icons to speed scanning (kept minimal and consistent).
- [ ] If using modules (agenda/what’s included), keep them scannable (short labels).

## 4) Pricing & Framing (If shown here)
- [ ] Price presented with clear value framing (original vs. now / or “what’s included”).
- [ ] If multiple tiers exist, mark one as “Most popular” (avoid more than 3 tiers).
- [ ] Avoid dense tables; prefer elegant cards or a simple list.

## 5) CTA & Two-Step Flow (Data → Payment)
- [ ] Primary CTA label is action-oriented (e.g., “Reserve my seat”).
- [ ] Micro-assurance under CTA (e.g., “Step 1: save your spot. Step 2: payment.”).
- [ ] Clear indication of **Step 1** (short form) and **Step 2** (checkout).
- [ ] Optional secondary CTA (low-friction), e.g., “Ask a question” or “See details”.

## 6) Form (Step 1: CRM Capture)
- [ ] Only essential fields (name, email, phone if truly needed).
- [ ] Single column, large touch targets, clear labels.
- [ ] Inline validation and one clear submit action.
- [ ] Consent/GDPR checkbox with concise wording (Portugal/EU compliant).
- [ ] Success state is obvious (progress to payment or clear next steps).

## 7) Urgency & Scarcity (Tasteful)
- [ ] Simple, believable cues (e.g., “Limited seats” / “Early-bird ends DD/MM”).
- [ ] Optional small countdown or seat indicator (non-intrusive).
- [ ] Urgency near CTA, not dominating the layout.

## 8) Social Proof & Trust
- [ ] One compact proof element near CTA (star-rating, badge, or short testimonial).
- [ ] Trust badges (secure checkout, venue credibility) kept subtle.
- [ ] If you have a full Social Proof section elsewhere, **keep this minimal** here.

## 9) Imagery & Aesthetics
- [ ] One strong, relevant image (aspirational, in-room energy, Lisbon vibe if on-brand).
- [ ] Image supports the promise; doesn’t compete with the CTA.
- [ ] Color palette follows your style guide; CTA uses a high-contrast accent.
- [ ] Elegant typography hierarchy (headline > subhead > bullets); no cramped lines.

## 10) Motion & Micro-interactions
- [ ] Subtle hover/press states on buttons (tactile feedback).
- [ ] Gentle reveal animations (e.g., fade/slide for bullets) with low intensity.
- [ ] Avoid flashy effects; motion should guide attention, not distract.

## 11) Accessibility & Readability
- [ ] Text/background contrast meets WCAG (aim AA+).
- [ ] Minimum 16px body text; generous line height for lists.
- [ ] Buttons have clear labels; form fields have visible labels (not placeholder-only).
- [ ] Keyboard navigable; focus states visible.

## 12) Mobile-First Checks
- [ ] Stack order preserves the eye path: headline → benefits → CTA → form.
- [ ] Sticky or repeated CTA if section is tall.
- [ ] Touch targets ≥44px; inputs use correct keyboards (email, tel).
- [ ] Images responsive; no tiny text overlays.

## 13) Performance & Clarity
- [ ] Optimize images; avoid heavy video in the offer block.
- [ ] Keep copy succinct; remove non-essential words.
- [ ] No competing CTAs or links that pull away from conversion.

## 14) Analytics & Experimentation
- [ ] Track clicks on primary/secondary CTAs and form completion (Step-1 → Step-2).
- [ ] A/B test: headline, CTA copy, benefit order, micro-assurances.
- [ ] Monitor mobile vs. desktop conversion and adjust layout accordingly.

## 15) Legal & Confidence
- [ ] GDPR consent + link to Privacy/Terms (clean, unobtrusive).
- [ ] Refund/transfer policy summarized in a short, reassuring line (if applicable).
- [ ] Venue/date/time clearly visible or one click away (reduce purchase anxiety).

### Quick Do / Don’t
- [ ] **Do:** Lead with the promise, support with 3–5 benefits, make the CTA unmistakable.
- [ ] **Do:** Use whitespace and contrast to create an effortless reading flow.
- [ ] **Do:** Keep Step-1 form ultra-short; reassure about the two-step process.
- [ ] **Don’t:** Overload with features, dense pricing tables, or multiple competing CTAs.
- [ ] **Don’t:** Let imagery overshadow the CTA or reduce text legibility.
- [ ] **Don’t:** Fake scarcity or use aggressive countdowns that feel spammy.

### Optional Blocks (Use Sparingly)
- [ ] Mini “What’s Included” grid (icons + labels).
- [ ] Bonus/early-bird ribbon on the card.
- [ ] Tiny testimonial chip beside CTA (1–2 lines max).
