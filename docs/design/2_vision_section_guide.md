# Vision Section Checklist (Beauty × Conversion)

Use this checklist to design a **dream-led Vision section** that feels premium, human, and high‑converting—without locking your creativity. Keep it adaptable to photo‑heavy *or* typographic layouts, with subtle motion only.

---

## 1) Purpose & Framing
- [ ] This section **replaces “Problem”** with an aspirational *Vision/Future Self*.
- [ ] The intent is clear in one glance: **who it’s for** and **what future it promises**.
- [ ] Tone is **warm, confident, and empowering** (no fear‑based copy).

---

## 2) Visual Hierarchy (Eye Path: First → Second → Third)
- [ ] **FIRST:** A single dominant focal point (usually the headline *or* a strong image).
- [ ] **SECOND:** A short, clarifying subhead or 3–5 concise outcome bullets.
- [ ] **THIRD:** A **primary CTA** positioned where the eye naturally lands next.
- [ ] Whitespace isolates the focal point; nothing competes with the headline.
- [ ] Hierarchy reads cleanly in **F- or Z-pattern** on desktop; stacked logic on mobile.

> Tip: If using a person photo, their gaze subtly points toward the headline or CTA.

---

## 3) Layout Options (choose one, keep it simple)
- [ ] **Split Layout:** Text left, image right (desktop). Stacks with text above image on mobile.
- [ ] **Centered Typographic:** Big headline, short subhead, CTA below, optional small proof line.
- [ ] **Full‑bleed Image with Overlay:** Soft overlay for contrast; text block anchored to one side.

> Guideline: One section ≈ one screen height on desktop; allow a natural scroll on mobile.

---

## 4) Copy Blocks (keep it vivid, not long)
- [ ] **Section label (optional):** “Vision”, “Your Next Chapter”, or brand‑aligned variant.
- [ ] **Headline:** Identity + outcome + ease (concise, specific, believable).
- [ ] **Subhead or Outcomes:** 3–5 tangible results (clarity, rhythm, simplicity, consistency).
- [ ] **Credibility shard:** 1 short proof (mini testimonial/stat/“dozens served”). 
- [ ] **Gentle contrast (optional):** Neutral line acknowledging friction without “pain marketing”.
- [ ] **Reassurance micro‑copy:** “No fluff. A simple method you can sustain.”

---

## 5) Imagery & Aesthetic
- [ ] Imagery evokes **future‑self calm + capability** (avoid cliché “hustle” stock).
- [ ] Image and background colors harmonize with **brand palette**; contrast is accessible.
- [ ] If overlaying text on image, ensure **WCAG‑friendly** contrast; use soft overlay if needed.
- [ ] Composition uses **rule of thirds** or generous negative space—never cluttered.
- [ ] Iconography (if any) is minimal, consistent, and secondary to the message.

---

## 6) Typography & Spacing
- [ ] Clear **type scale**: headline >> subhead >> body; short line lengths for readability.
- [ ] Pair brand headline and body fonts; tracking/leading tuned for elegance and legibility.
- [ ] **Generous spacing** around key blocks; avoid dense walls of text.
- [ ] No more than **one** emphasis treatment per line (e.g., bold *or* color, not both).

---

## 7) CTA & Conversion Cues
- [ ] **Primary CTA** is prominent, above the fold on most devices.
- [ ] Button label is **benefit‑oriented** (e.g., “Reserve my seat”, “Quero esse novo ritmo”).
- [ ] Two‑step flow is **transparent but light**: Step 1 (details) → Step 2 (payment).
- [ ] Optional **micro‑proof/urgency** near CTA (“limited seats”, “Lisbon • 7 hours”).
- [ ] Secondary action (if any) is visually soft (e.g., “See what’s included”) and not competing.

---

## 8) Motion & Micro‑Interactions (subtle by default)
- [ ] Enter animations are **brief and gentle** (opacity/translate ≤ ~300ms, once).
- [ ] Elements reveal in **reading order** (headline → subhead/bullets → CTA).
- [ ] CTA hover state provides **tactile feedback** (slight elevation/contrast change).
- [ ] Respect **prefers‑reduced‑motion**; section reads perfectly with motion off.

---

## 9) Accessibility, Performance & Responsiveness
- [ ] Text contrast passes **AA**; interactive elements have clear focus states.
- [ ] Images are optimized; no heavy media that harms LCP/CLS.
- [ ] Mobile: tap targets ≥ 44px, comfortable spacing, no overflow clipping.
- [ ] Layout gracefully adapts from **≥1440px** down to **360px** without breaking hierarchy.
- [ ] All meaningful text is real text (not baked into images).

---

## 10) Creative Guardrails (to stay beautiful)
- [ ] One concept per section; **remove** anything that doesn’t serve the vision or CTA.
- [ ] Limit decorative elements to **one subtle motif** max.
- [ ] Avoid carousels, autoplay videos with sound, and busy background effects.
- [ ] Keep copy **specific and grounded** (time, place, artifact attendees take away).

---

## 11) Quick A/B Ideas
- [ ] Headline: identity‑led vs outcome‑led.
- [ ] Imagery: serene solo founder vs intimate group energy.
- [ ] Layout: split (text|image) vs centered typographic.
- [ ] CTA verb: “Reserve seat” vs “Start my new rhythm”.

---

## 12) Final QA (ship checklist)
- [ ] At a glance, I grasp **the promise, for whom, and the next action**.
- [ ] The eye flows **headline → outcomes → CTA** without friction.
- [ ] The section feels **premium, calm, and confident**—not loud or busy.
- [ ] Everything aligns with **brand palette, type, and voice**.
- [ ] On mobile, it’s equally **clear, beautiful, and actionable**.
