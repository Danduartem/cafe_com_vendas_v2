# Problem Section — Best Practices Checklist

> Use this as a flexible, design-first reference. Keep it beautiful, empathetic, and conversion-oriented without getting “circus-y”.

---

## 1) Purpose & Strategy
- [ ] I’m clear that this section’s sole job is to **make the visitor feel understood** and **create desire for the solution**.
- [ ] I’m describing **one primary problem** (not a laundry list).
- [ ] Tone is **empathetic, human, and non-blaming**.

---

## 2) Message & Copy
- [ ] **Headline mirrors the visitor’s pain** in 6–12 words (question or strong statement).
- [ ] **Subhead (1–2 short sentences)** expands the pain and stakes in plain language.
- [ ] Optional **bullets (2–4 max)**: concrete symptoms or consequences (time lost, stress, missed revenue).
- [ ] End with a **hope pivot** (e.g., “It doesn’t have to be this way…”).
- [ ] Copy uses **“you” language**, avoids jargon, and matches my brand voice/style guide.

---

## 3) Psychology Triggers (use lightly)
- [ ] **Loss aversion**: what’s at risk if nothing changes (time, energy, money, momentum).
- [ ] **Social mirroring/belonging**: “many founders face this…” (reassures, reduces shame).
- [ ] **Credibility nudge** (optional): 1 relevant stat or insight (kept short).
- [ ] **Optimism**: hint that relief is coming (sets up the Solution section).

---

## 4) Visual Hierarchy & Eye Flow (first → second → third)
- [ ] **First:** Headline has the highest visual weight (size/contrast/whitespace).
- [ ] **Second:** Subhead/bullets are clearly subordinate but highly readable.
- [ ] **Third:** Supporting visual (photo/illustration) **reinforces** the problem, not distracts.
- [ ] **Directional cues** (image gaze/arrow/shape) subtly lead eyes **toward the Solution section**.
- [ ] Ample **whitespace** around key elements; no visual clutter.

---

## 5) Layout Patterns (pick one and keep it clean)
- [ ] **Two-column**: text left, image right (LTR reading) OR flipped if the image pulls attention helpfully.
- [ ] **Single-column hero-style**: big headline, short subhead, supporting visual below.
- [ ] **Card/stacked**: headline block → micro-points → visual accent → transition cue.
- [ ] **Section transition** is obvious (divider, angled shape, color shift, or “See how to fix this ↓”).

---

## 6) Imagery
- [ ] Image **depicts the feeling or consequence** (overwhelm, busywork, missed chances).
- [ ] If a person is shown, their **line of sight** points toward headline/copy.
- [ ] Style matches brand (color grading, composition) per style guide.
- [ ] Avoid cliché stock; prefer authentic, minimal, or brand-aligned illustration.
- [ ] If using background images, add a **subtle overlay** to preserve text contrast.

---

## 7) Color & Contrast
- [ ] Background and text meet **accessibility contrast**; key phrases may use brand accent.
- [ ] Use **one** accent color to highlight the pain/keywords (no rainbowing).
- [ ] Consider a **temperature contrast** (warm accent on calm base) to signal urgency without shouting.

---

## 8) Typography
- [ ] Clear hierarchy: **H1 > subhead > body/bullets** (size, weight, spacing).
- [ ] Short line lengths (≈45–75 chars) and generous line-height for readability.
- [ ] **Emphasis** (bold/italic) only on critical phrases (don’t overuse).
- [ ] Matches brand fonts per style guide.

---

## 9) Micro-Interactions (keep tasteful)
- [ ] Subtle **fade/slide in** on scroll (low distance, low duration).
- [ ] No parallax or heavy motion that distracts from reading.
- [ ] Hover states (if any) are restrained and **consistent**.

---

## 10) Mobile & Responsiveness
- [ ] Mobile layout stacks **headline → subhead → bullets → visual** (no cramped columns).
- [ ] Font sizes scale for comfortable reading; tap targets have proper spacing.
- [ ] Heavy images are **optimized**; no layout shift on load.

---

## 11) Accessibility & Performance
- [ ] Images have **alt text** that reflects the problem context.
- [ ] Colors meet **WCAG** contrast; motion respects **reduced motion** preferences.
- [ ] Images **compressed**; no blocking scripts; section paints quickly.

---

## 12) Conversion Alignment (bridge to Solution)
- [ ] Clear **downward cue** or line linking to the Solution section (“How we fix this”).
- [ ] Optional **soft micro-CTA**: “See the solution” (kept secondary; main purchase CTA appears later).
- [ ] No competing CTAs inside the Problem section.

---

## 13) Final Polish & QA
- [ ] **Squint test**: headline reads first, then subhead, then visual—nothing else shouts.
- [ ] **Read-aloud test**: sounds empathetic, concise, and human.
- [ ] **Brand alignment**: matches style guide (color, type, tone).
- [ ] **Content check**: one problem, tangible stakes, hopeful transition—ready to hand off to Solution.
