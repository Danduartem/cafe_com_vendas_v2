# About Me Section — Design Checklist

> A flexible, beauty-first, conversion-minded guide you can reuse on any landing page.

---

## 1) Purpose & Outcome
- [ ] I defined the goal of this section (trust + personal connection → move toward ticket purchase).
- [ ] I framed my story in terms of the visitor’s desired outcome (sell more, work fewer hours).
- [ ] I keep this section a teaser (not a full bio) to maintain momentum.

---

## 2) First-Glance Eye-Path (1-2-3)
- [ ] **1st:** Section label (“About” / “Meet [Name]”) or my name is instantly visible.
- [ ] **2nd:** A high-quality portrait draws attention and warmth.
- [ ] **3rd:** A short hook + 2–4 scannable lines clarify who I am and why it matters.

---

## 3) Visual Composition
- [ ] Clean two-column layout (image ↔ text) on desktop; single column on mobile.
- [ ] Generous whitespace; nothing feels cramped.
- [ ] Clear grouping: label → headline → subhead → short bio → proof → micro-CTA.
- [ ] Alignment is consistent (baseline grids, equal paddings, even gutters).

---

## 4) Portrait & Imagery
- [ ] Crisp, friendly, well-lit photo; eyes visible; approachable expression.
- [ ] Background is simple or on-brand; no busy distractions.
- [ ] Optional subtle frame/shape/border that matches the brand (kept minimal).
- [ ] If possible, subject gaze subtly points toward copy or CTA.

---

## 5) Copy Structure (Short & Human)
- [ ] **Hook line** that mirrors the audience’s reality (overwork → smarter selling).
- [ ] **Who I am** (role, specialization) in one clear sentence.
- [ ] **Why trust me** (one proof point or result) in one line.
- [ ] **Mini story** (1 sentence) that shows empathy + transformation.
- [ ] **Tone:** warm, confident, direct; speaks to female entrepreneurs in Lisbon.

---

## 6) Authority & Proof (Lightweight)
- [ ] One standout credential or quantified result (e.g., “helped X founders…”).
- [ ] Optional micro-badges/logos/testimonial snippet (small, tasteful).
- [ ] Proof elements don’t visually overpower the narrative.

---

## 7) CTA Integration (Micro-Conversion)
- [ ] A discreet **micro-CTA** at the end (e.g., “Reserve your seat” / “Start Step 1”).
- [ ] CTA visually connected to brand accents; sized smaller than primary CTAs.
- [ ] Copy reinforces the benefit (sell more, work less).

---

## 8) Brand Consistency (Use Your Style Guide)
- [ ] Headings/body use the brand’s assigned type pairings.
- [ ] Colors respect the palette (primary for text; accent for small highlights/CTA).
- [ ] Section label (“eyebrow”) uses the brand’s small-caps/weight/color treatment.
- [ ] Iconography or motifs (if any) are subtle and consistent.

---

## 9) Motion & Micro-Interactions (Subtle Beauty)
- [ ] Gentle fade/slide on section reveal (no circus effects).
- [ ] Image hover or parallax is optional and minimal.
- [ ] Focus states and hover states are polished and consistent.

---

## 10) Mobile & Responsiveness
- [ ] Stacked layout with the **photo above** headline or vice-versa (test both).
- [ ] Comfortable font sizes/line-height;
- [ ] Spacing preserved; no orphaned lines or awkward wraps.

---

## 11) Accessibility & Readability
- [ ] Text/background contrast meets WCAG AA.
- [ ] Image has descriptive alt text (e.g., “Portrait of [Name], [Role]”).
- [ ] Headings follow a logical hierarchy (H2 section title, H3 headline, etc.).
- [ ] Links/buttons are keyboard accessible and clearly labeled.

---

## 12) Performance & Hygiene
- [ ] Portrait is optimized (modern format, responsive sizes, lazy-loaded).
- [ ] No layout shift (reserve image dimensions).
- [ ] Copy free of jargon; no walls of text (max ~90–120 words total).

---

## 13) Variants to Test (Optional)
- [ ] **Layout:** image-left vs image-right.
- [ ] **Lead:** results-first vs story-first hook.
- [ ] **CTA copy:** “Reserve your seat” vs “Start Step 1”.
- [ ] **Proof style:** single stat vs micro-testimonial.

---

## 14) Pre-Publish QA
- [ ] Skim test: in 3 seconds I grasp who you are + why it matters.
- [ ] Scroll test: section feels light, elegant, and invites the next section.
- [ ] Brand test: typography, color, and tone match the rest of the page.
- [ ] Link test: micro-CTA routes correctly to Step 1 of the 2-step flow.
