# Hero Section Best Practices — Checklist

> Use this as a flexible reference to design a visually stunning, high-converting hero. Keep it simple, premium, and focused.

## 1) Frame & Goal
- [ ] In 3 seconds, a visitor can tell **what it is**, **who it’s for**, and **what to do next**.
- [ ] Primary promise is clear (transformation > features), aligned to your audience’s core desire.
- [ ] Exactly **one** primary action (CTA) aligned to your 2-step funnel (lead → payment).

## 2) Layout & Eye Path
- [ ] Headline placed where eyes land first (top-left or center), with strong visual dominance.
- [ ] Elements arranged to support **F/Z reading patterns**; no competing focal points.
- [ ] Subtle **directional cues** (gaze direction, arrow, angle) nudge attention toward the CTA.
- [ ] **Whitespace** creates breathing room around headline and CTA.

## 3) Headline
- [ ] 6–12 words; outcome/benefit-driven; no jargon.
- [ ] States WHO it’s for + WHAT they gain (sell more, work fewer hours).
- [ ] Readable at arm’s length on mobile; no ALL-CAPS blocks.

## 4) Subheadline / Support
- [ ] One concise sentence clarifies *how* the result is achieved (e.g., live workshop in Lisbon).
- [ ] Optional **eyebrow/kicker** for context or proof (date, “exclusive”, small proof point).
- [ ] Essential logistics (date/location) shown as unobtrusive microtext if needed.

## 5) Visual (Image/Video/Illustration)
- [ ] High-quality, **authentic** visual that reinforces the promise (confident, joyful entrepreneurs).
- [ ] Never sacrifice legibility: use subtle overlay/gradient only to improve contrast.
- [ ] If video: short (<8s), muted, optimized, with a static fallback; does not overpower text.
- [ ] Avoid “stocky” feel; prioritize relatability and credibility.

## 6) CTA (Primary)
- [ ] One **primary CTA** above the fold (e.g., “Garantir a minha vaga”). Action-oriented, first-person.
- [ ] Visually **contrasting** button (brand accent) with comfortable spacing around it.
- [ ] Optional microcopy under CTA sets expectations (e.g., “Etapa 1: reservar • Etapa 2: pagamento”).
- [ ] Any secondary link is low-emphasis (does not compete).

## 7) Trust & Urgency (Light-Touch)
- [ ] One **proof cue** near the hero (brief testimonial line, attendee count, logo row) — subtle styling.
- [ ] Gentle **scarcity** (“Vagas limitadas”, early-bird date) without anxiety-inducing visuals.
- [ ] No element visually outweighs the headline or primary CTA.

## 8) Brand, Color & Typography
- [ ] Use brand **primary** for body/headline text; **accent** for CTA/highlights.
- [ ] Strong contrast for legibility; keep palette to 2–3 mains + 1 accent.
- [ ] Clear type hierarchy: H1 (hero) > lead/sub > body; sentence case for readability.
- [ ] Consistent letter/line spacing; avoid cramped lines or overly wide measure.

## 9) Spacing & Composition
- [ ] Generous **padding** and consistent grid/gutters; edges never feel cramped.
- [ ] One visual focal point + one textual focal point; everything else supports.
- [ ] Hero height: aim for 70–90vh desktop (content not swallowed), mobile fits without awkward scroll.

## 10) Copy Tone & Voice
- [ ] Empathetic, empowering, specific to **female entrepreneurs**.
- [ ] Speaks to selling more with fewer hours; confident and warm (no hype).
- [ ] Concrete, plain-language phrases; avoid vagueness and clichés.

## 11) Accessibility & Performance
- [ ] Text contrast: ≥ 4.5:1 (body) / ≥ 3:1 (large text). Semantic **H1** present.
- [ ] Alt text for meaningful images; descriptive button text/aria-label if needed.
- [ ] Optimize media (compression, modern formats); LCP target < 2.5s; minimal blocking scripts.

## 12) Mobile & Responsiveness
- [ ] Touch-friendly CTA (≥ 44×44 px target).
- [ ] Stack order preserves eye path: **Headline → Subheadline → CTA → Visual**.
- [ ] Text never over busy areas; test common widths (360–430px).

## 13) Variants & Measurement
- [ ] One **big idea** per hero; remove non-essentials.
- [ ] Track hero CTA clicks + scroll-depth; map to **Step-1 lead** and **Step-2 payment** events.
- [ ] A/B test **one variable at a time** (headline *or* visual), not full redesigns.

## 14) Pre-Launch 5-Second Test
- [ ] A new visitor can answer: **What is this? Who is it for? Why should I care? What do I do next?**
- [ ] Nothing competes with the headline and primary CTA.
- [ ] Visuals feel premium, calm, and confident — not noisy or cluttered.
