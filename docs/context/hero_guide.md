Composition & Layout
	•	Single focal point. One thing owns the frame (product, person, result). No competing animations.
	•	Eye path triangle (1-2-3): H1 → Primary CTA → Proof/Chips. Arrange them as a gentle triangle, not a straight column.
	•	Grid: 12-col; container 1120–1280px. Text block spans 5–6 cols; image/focal gets the rest.
	•	Safe zones: Keep text within a 48–56ch column; avoid edges. Maintain at least 80px padding top/bottom on laptop.
	•	Hero height: 650–800px on desktop; on mobile, first viewport shows H1 + CTA without scrolling.

Background Treatment
	•	Use negative space. Choose imagery with a calm area behind text (or place text on the calm side).
	•	Scrim overlay: Always add one over photos/video to guarantee legibility.
	•	Linear for split layouts; radial for centered layouts.
	•	Opacity guideline: 55–75% cumulative darkness beneath text.
	•	Example: radial 120% @ center 60% from rgba(0,0,0,.66) to .82.
	•	Blur & noise (optional): 2–4px blur on busy bokeh; 1–2% film grain to avoid banding in gradients.

Imagery & Video
	•	Art direction: Crop for rule-of-thirds; leave empty third for text. Subject faces toward content/CTA.
	•	Color grading: Slightly desaturate and lower contrast so text/CTA can pop. Keep skin tones natural.
	•	Video loop: 3–5s, no sound, minimal motion (hands, cursor, subtle pan). Only one moving element above the fold.
	•	File prep: Desktop 2560×1440 (WebP/MP4), mobile alternate crop with same focal logic.

Color & Contrast
	•	Palette: 1 brand color, 1 neutral, 1 accent (CTA). Background stays quiet.
	•	Contrast: Text/background ≥ 4.5:1 (≥3:1 for large H1). Check CTA label on its fill too.
	•	CTA color strategy: Solid fill in the accent color; hover = lighten/darken 8–12%; focus ring = same hue at 35–45% opacity.

Typography (purely visual rules)
	•	Families: Max 2 (display + text). Keep weights consistent (700/800 for H1, 400/500 for sub).
	•	Scale:
	•	H1: 44–64px desktop, 28–36px mobile (tight letter-spacing −1% to −2%).
	•	Subhead: 18–22px; body chips 14–16px.
	•	Line length: 45–75 characters.
	•	Line height: H1 1.05–1.15; sub/body 1.4–1.6.
	•	No italics over photos. Use weight/size for hierarchy, not style effects.

Spacing & Rhythm
	•	8-pt system: Space in 8s (16/24/32/48).
	•	Vertical rhythm (desktop):
	•	Eyebrow → H1: 8–12px
	•	H1 → Subhead: 12–20px
	•	Subhead → CTA row: 16–24px
	•	CTA row → Proof/Chips: 12–16px
	•	Whitespace: Let the left/right margin breathe; never crowd the edges to “fit more”.

Buttons & Chips (visual spec)
	•	Primary CTA: Pill or 12–16px radius; min width 180–220px; padding 14–18px; bold label. One shadow only (soft, 16–24px blur, low spread).
	•	Secondary CTA: Ghost or subtle underline; never equal weight to primary.
	•	Chips/Badges: Translucent neutral (e.g., white at 10–15% on dark), thin 1px border at 15–20% opacity, pill radius.

Motion & Depth
	•	Micro-motion: 150–250ms ease-out on fade/slide-in; stagger H1 → CTA by 40–80ms.
	•	Parallax: If used, <10% movement relative to scroll.
	•	Depth: Prefer ambient shadow + layered scrims over heavy drops. Avoid neon glows.

Responsive Art Direction
	•	Swap crops: Use alternate mobile image with the focal point preserved; keep the text on the calm side.
	•	Stacking order (mobile): Eyebrow → H1 → CTA → Proof → Chips; image can sit behind or below as needed.
	•	Tap targets: CTA height ≥ 44px; spacing between buttons ≥ 8–12px.

Pattern Recipes (pick one)
	1.	Centered Text over Calm Photo: Radial scrim, tight H1 center, CTA row centered, proof below.
	2.	Split Hero (Text Left, Visual Right): Linear scrim from left (darker → lighter), H1 aligns to grid left, visual bleeds right.
	3.	Product on Pedestal: Solid/gradient neutral background, product with soft shadow, minimal reflections, no photo; ultra-crisp.
	4.	Video Slice: Narrow video window (30–40% height) behind H1; everything else static.

Do / Avoid (quick scan)
	•	Do: One focal, one motion, quiet background, consistent radius/edges, balanced negative space.
	•	Avoid: Text on un-scrimmed photo, multiple gradients, over-contrasty backgrounds, equal-weight CTAs, more than two fonts, busy top bars stealing attention.

Final Visual Checklist
	•	H1 is clearly the brightest/heaviest element.
	•	CTA is the next most visually salient thing.
	•	Background supports, never competes (scrim in place).
	•	Line length and spacing feel airy, not cramped.
	•	Only one animated element visible.
	•	All text and the CTA pass contrast on the chosen background.
	•	Mobile crop preserves the same focal narrative.

Use this as your yardstick—if any element breaks hierarchy, quiet it down until the H1 → CTA → Proof triangle is unmistakable.
