```
5 = Can implement in <2 minutes with instant benefit
4 = Can implement in <5 minutes with clear benefit
3 = Can implement in <10 minutes with good benefit
2 = Requires 10-30 minutes but valuable
1 = Requires >30 minutes or unclear implementation
0 = No actionable value or requires purchase
```

3 = General success metrics
2 = Testimonial without specifics
1 = Claim without evidence
0 = No proof provided
```

#### 4. Clarity (0-5 points)
```
5 = Skimmable in 30 seconds, action crystal clear
4 = Skimmable in 60 seconds, action clear
3 = Readable in 90 seconds, action mostly clear
2 = Takes 2-3 minutes, action somewhat clear
1 = Takes >3 minutes or action unclear
0 = Confusing or no clear action
```

#### 5. Alignment (0-5 points)
```
5 = Perfectly matches segment's primary pain
4 = Strongly relevant to segment needs

1 = Weak connection to needs
0 = Misaligned or irrelevant
```

### Minimum Passing Score: 12/15

- **12**: Acceptable, ship with notes
- **11-9**: Revise value proposition
- **8-6**: Major rework needed
- **<6**: Reject and restart

## üìä Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Pre-Flight Check
```yaml
Email ID: welcome_01
Sequence: Welcome
Target Segment: New leads - overwhelmed
Stated Value: Content planning template

Pre-check:
- [ ] Has value block identified?
- [ ] Has proof element?
- [ ] Has clear action?
- [ ] Ask comes after value?
```

### Step 2: Detailed Scoring
```yaml
Scoring Breakdown:

Immediate Utility: 4/5
- Template ready to use
- Takes 5 minutes to complete
- Deduction: Requires Notion account

Specificity: 5/5  
- Addresses Portuguese market
- Female entrepreneur language
- Specific pain: content overwhelm

Proof: 4/5
- "Marta: 4 meetings in 10 days"
- Specific outcome and timeframe
- Deduction: Could use more context

Clarity: 5/5

- Template link prominent
- 45-second read time

Alignment: 5/5
- Directly addresses time overwhelm
- Solves content planning pain
- Relevant to segment stage

TOTAL: 23/25 = 92% (PASS - Excellent)
```

### Step 3: Feedback Generation
```markdown
## Value QA Report: PASS (23/25)

### Strengths
‚úÖ Clear, immediate value with template
‚úÖ Perfect audience alignment
‚úÖ Strong proof with specific outcome
‚úÖ Skimmable in <60 seconds
