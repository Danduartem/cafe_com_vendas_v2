## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. **Start with Orchestrators for Complex Tasks**
For multi-faceted requests, use orchestrators to coordinate specialist agents efficiently.

### 2. **Use Specialists for Focused Work**
For specific tasks, go directly to the specialist agent rather than an orchestrator.

### 3. **Leverage Proactive Agents**
Agents marked "Use PROACTIVELY" will be automatically activated when relevant.

### 4. **Follow the Hierarchy**
- Orchestrators ‚Üí coordinate multiple agents
- Specialists ‚Üí handle specific domains
- Base template ‚Üí shared context for all

### 5. **Check Dependencies**
Some agents work better together:
- `conversion-optimizer` + `portuguese-copywriter`
- `design-compliance-specialist` + `performance-auditor`
- `stripe-event-specialist` + `email-automation-specialist`

## üìù Agent Metadata

All agents inherit from `01-base-template.md` which provides:
- Shared project context (Caf√© com Vendas details)
- Technical stack information
- Compliance rules (WCAG AA, CSP, Tailwind)
- Performance standards
- Standard output formats

## üîß Configuration

Agents are configured with:
- **name**: Unique identifier for activation
- **description**: What the agent does and when to use it
- **model**: AI model to use (usually `sonnet`)
- **Inherits from**: Base template for shared context

## üí° Tips

1. **Multiple agents can work in parallel** - Orchestrators manage dependencies
2. **Agents share context** - Information flows between coordinated agents
3. **Use natural language** - Just describe what you need
4. **Check agent descriptions** - Each file contains detailed capabilities
5. **Combine agents** - Complex tasks benefit from multi-agent collaboration

## üö® Important Notes

- Agents follow all project guidelines in `CLAUDE.md`
- All agents enforce Pure Tailwind CSS (no inline styles)
- All agents ensure WCAG AA compliance
- All agents respect CSP security policies
- Portuguese copy is always pt-PT (not pt-BR)
